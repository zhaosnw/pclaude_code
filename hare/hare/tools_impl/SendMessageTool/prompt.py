## Cross-session

Use `ListPeers` to discover targets, then:

```json
{"to": "uds:/tmp/cc-socks/1234.sock", "message": "check if tests pass over there"}
{"to": "bridge:session_01AbCd...", "message": "what branch are you on?"}
```

A listed peer is alive and will process your message \u2014 no "busy" state; messages enqueue and drain at the receiver's next tool round. Your message arrives wrapped as `<cross-session-message from="...">`. **To reply to an incoming message, copy its `from` attribute as your `to`.**"""

    return f"""# SendMessage

Send a message to another agent.

```json
{{"to": "researcher", "summary": "assign task 1", "message": "start on task #1"}}
```

| `to` | |
|---|---|
| `"researcher"` | Teammate by name |
| `"*"` | Broadcast to all teammates \u2014 expensive (linear in team size), use only when everyone genuinely needs it |{uds_row}

Your plain text output is NOT visible to other agents \u2014 to communicate, you MUST call this tool. Messages from teammates are delivered automatically; you don't check an inbox. Refer to teammates by name, never by UUID. When relaying, don't quote the original \u2014 it's already rendered to the user.{uds_section}

## Protocol responses (legacy)

If you receive a JSON message with `type: "shutdown_request"` or `type: "plan_approval_request"`, respond with the matching `_response` type \u2014 echo the `request_id`, set `approve` true/false:

```json
{{"to": "team-lead", "message": {{"type": "shutdown_response", "request_id": "...", "approve": true}}}}
{{"to": "researcher", "message": {{"type": "plan_approval_response", "request_id": "...", "approve": false, "feedback": "add error handling"}}}}
```

Approving shutdown terminates your process. Rejecting plan sends the teammate back to revise. Don't originate `shutdown_request` unless asked. Don't send structured JSON status messages \u2014 use TaskUpdate."""
